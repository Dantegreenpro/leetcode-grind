My Solutions to LeetCode &amp; coding challenges in python
# LeetCode Grind 🚀

This repository contains my solutions to coding challenges (mainly from LeetCode).  
I’m using this repo to practice problem-solving, build muscle memory, and track my progress as I grow as a developer.

## 📂 Structure
Each problem is stored as a standalone Python file.  
Example:
two_sum.py
find_disappeared_numbers.py
power_of_two.py

Later I may organize into folders:

arrays/
strings/
math/
